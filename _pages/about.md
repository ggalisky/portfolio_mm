I'm an engineer and nature adventurer.

The intersection between hardware and software has become my focus over the last few years. 

Professionally I've worked on hardware and software for satellites, dive computers, hardware in the loop testers, and industrial 3D printers. I currently work at [Zoox](https://zoox.com) on vehicle simulation platforms and at [Depth Dive Computers](https://www.depthdiving.com) designing and building the next generation of freediving computers.

I studied electrical engineering at [CSULB](https://www.csulb.edu) where I received my Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering.
