I'm an engineer and and adventurer. 

My engineering interests are broad, and as a result of this I tend to select projects that include a mix mechanical, electrical and software engineering. In the last couple years I have been more focused on the intersection between hardware and software. 

Professionally I've worked on hardware and software for satellites, dive computers, hardware in the loop testers, and industrial 3D printers.

I currently work at Zoox as a hardware software integration engineer on the hardware in the loop test platform development team, and at Depth Dive Computers designing and building the next generation of freediving computers
