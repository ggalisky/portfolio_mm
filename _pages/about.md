I'm an engineer and nature adventurer. I am also a PFI certified freediver and can dive up to 41m (135ft) and back on a single breath.

My engineering interests are broad, and as a result of this I tend to select projects that include a mix mechanical, electrical and software engineering. In the last couple years I have been more focused on the intersection between hardware and software. I studied electrical engineering at [California State University Long Beach](https://www.csulb.edu) where I received my Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering.

Professionally I've worked on hardware and software for satellites, dive computers, hardware in the loop testers, and industrial 3D printers. I currently work at [Zoox](https://zoox.com) on vehicle simulation platforms and at [Depth Dive Computers](https://www.depthdiving.com) designing and building the next generation of freediving computers.
