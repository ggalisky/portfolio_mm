For my EE 471 Design of Control Systems Course my team and I built an inverted pendulum with a reaction wheel for the end effector

We modeled the physics of the system with state space and then utilized a LQR controller to perform the actual stabilization. More information about the state space modeling and LQR controller can be found in the [youtube video linked here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlYtwWM7urA). 

Solidworks was used to get mass estimates on the various parts as well as center of mass data. 

The system consists of a BLDC motor, a couple rotary encoders, 3D printed parts, and metal fasteners. For electronics, the system uses a Arduino Uno and the [simpleFOC Arduino Uno Shield](https://simplefoc.com/).

The project is inspired by this [github page](https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC-reaction-wheel-inverted-pendulum), but I have modified the CAD files to fit my particular setup.
