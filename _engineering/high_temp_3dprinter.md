I've been building and designing FDM 3D printers [since high school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWW_B8uRUUc), and I wanted to take on what I felt is the pinnacle of DIY 3D printers: a large-format 3D printer with a heated build chamber. A heated build chamber, in the context of a 3D printer, is basically an oven. A heated build area allows for warp-free printing of ABS and PC. Additionally, it also allows you to print PEEK, PEI, PPSU, and other high-temp exotic filaments. Building a robot that operates inside an oven is tricky, since most electronics will stop working around 80째C. Through clever engineering and trial and error, I was able to develop a system of flexible thermal barriers that kept the sensitive electronics and motion platform parts outside of the heated chamber. More [photos of the build can be found here](https://imgur.com/a/guFPFbn).

The final specs I ended up with were: 
- Temperatures: 500째C Nozzle Max, 250째C Bed Max, 150째C Chamber Max
- CoreXY motion system with 21.5x12x18in build volume, Ball screw for Z-axis
- Heated bed, heated chamber, flexible thermal barriers
- Hotend: E3D Titan Aqua, E3D Super Volcano, E3D .6mm Copper Plated Super Volcano Nozzle, PT100 Temp Sensor
- Electronics: Duet WiFi, Nema 23s
- Removable spring steel build plate held on by high-temp magnets (Samarium Cobalt - SmCo), PEI build surface

I used the following tools: 
- Solidworks
- Manual mill
- Plasma CNC table
- Angle grinder, bandsaw, drill press, and basic hand tools.
